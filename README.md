# readme-generator

## Description 


As we have now come to learn, README files are a necessary part of coding practices and development as a whole. This project
is centered around the need to quickly generate a professionally structured README file within seconds instead of minutes, 
sometimes even hours. By running node index.js into the integrated vscode terminal, you'll be able to test and generate your 
own professional README that would meet most employer standards. The code created for this application was built to reference 
how to use inquirer prompt for question arrays, switch operators for user selections, how to structure and generate a 
README markdown using NODE.js
